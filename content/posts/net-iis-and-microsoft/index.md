My question is  
"will .NET survive ?"  
Basically, there is a prediction of Windows loosing its market  
completely and the whole world go for the open source GNU/GPL  
OS Linux and other softwares.  
And according to a survery the number of companies deploying  
microsoft IIS servers are decreasing every year. If IIS isnt used  
then learning .NET is merely waste.  
Well, I personally feel as microsoft is introducing the next  
generation .NET based OS code named 'LongHorn' I am pretty sure there  
will be an increase in demand for .NET programmers but this may not  
b the same for longtime though.
