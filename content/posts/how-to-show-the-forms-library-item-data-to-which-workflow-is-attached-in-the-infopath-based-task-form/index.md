I have an infopath forms library list in my SharePoint site. (Forms library is basically a document library whose content type is of InfoPath forms type or xml document type) This list holds the request forms which end users submit using the browser based infopath form.



I have my custom workflow developed in VS 2005 attached to the abvoe forms/document library. My custom workflow has couple of task forms developed using InfoPath again, which the reviewer and approver uses to approve/re-assign/reject the request form.



My question is how to show the whole request forms data preferably with the same design and structure within the task forms. So here I am trying to show the request form which is a infopath form in a task form which is again another infopath form. May be atleast a readonly view of the request form will also suffice.



This helps the reviewer and the approver to see the client request within the task form and take the decision to approver or reject or re-assign.



I hope I am clear with my question. Please let me know your comments and a direction to go around to solve this. Thanks a lot guys :)
