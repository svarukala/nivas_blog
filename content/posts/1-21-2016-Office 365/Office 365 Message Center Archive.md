Office 365 Message Center Archive
=================================

[Srinivas Varukala](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Srinivas Varukala) 1/21/2016 9:52:00 AM

* * *

**UPDATE**(8/21/2017): This post is no longer up to date. I am no longer archiving the message center messages for many reasons (lack of time and lack of interest from community and lack of need based on search telemetry). I didn't find an archive of Office 365 message center messages and thus this blog post. I will do my best to keep this list updated as and when new messages pour into the message center. Office 365 change constantly, some are visible to end users, some are not and some too subtle we never observe. I have faced situations that kept me wondering if I ever missed this change announcement or questioning if message center ever announced it. This page will be helpful to come back anytime and do a quick search (ctrl + F) on this page or let the web crawlers do the work for us. Note that, this message center archive is **NOT** the exhaustive list of messages due to following reasons:

*   Firstly I started gathering these message starting 1/21/2016, so obviously I don't have the old messages that was posted and expired already.
*   Office 365 has different business plans (e.g. Enterprise E1, E3, E5; Government; Education; Non-Profit). Below message center archive is based on my tenant which is Enterprise E3.
*   Messages varies depending on what plans (Yammer, SharePoint, Exchange etc.) are enabled in your tenant too.
*   Office 365 Dedicated and Dedicated vNext tenants will have its own message center too. There might be some overlap with mult-tenant o365.

Attached is the excel spreadsheet since formatting this blog post is a time taking process.

Office 365 Planner Preview is on by default MC66139 This week you will begin seeing Office 365 Planner Preview on by default. In December, we rolled out Planner Preview to select First Release customers, to sign-up and assign Planner licenses their users. Today, we are rolling Office 365 Planner Preview out to all of First Release, without the need to sign-up and assign licenses. How does this affect me? Office 365 Planner Preview is now available, on by default, for you and your users. Planner Preview brings together teams, tasks, documents, and conversations for better planning and collaboration. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? There is nothing you need to do to prepare for this change. Log in and get yourself familiar with Planner.

Office 365 for Business Community is joining Microsoft Community MC66128 The Office 365 for Business Community (community.office365.com) is joining the Microsoft Community (answers.microsoft.com). This merger itself is scheduled for mid-to-late June, with additional integration taking place through August. Instead of looking in two different communities for answers, you only have to go to one place. Why are you merging the two communities? Microsoft Community is the largest support community hosted by Microsoft, and it already includes Windows and Office support. Once we bring Office 365 into the Microsoft Community, you’ll be able to search all forums at once, so you won’t miss anything the community is saying about your problem. For a full discussion of this change, click Additional information below. How does this affect me? We’re implementing these changes in two phases: Mid-to-late June, 2016: Office 365 for Business Community joins the Microsoft Community, and begins using a new set of forum topics dedicated to Office 365 for Business admins and users. For details, including how we’ll migrate accounts, avatars, and posts, click Additional information below. August, 2016: Office and Office for Mac forum topics will be simplified, and all topics for Office, Office for Mac, and Office 365 for Business will be organized under one main forum category called “Office.” Dedicated Office 365 for Business Administration topics will remain unchanged.

Updated feature: Simple sharing links now visible in Office 2013 and 2016 MC65775 We’re updating SharePoint and OneDrive, so simple sharing links will be visible within Office 2013 and Office 2016. This feature will begin rolling out May 23rd. How does this affect me? Currently, Office 2013 and Office 2016 do not display a simple sharing link (a link that anyone inside your organization can access) when organizations have anonymous links disabled in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. With this change, Office clients will display simple sharing links if they have this setting enabled. This will be true, even if they have anonymous (guest) links disabled. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? For the most part, you will not need to take any action for this change. If you have disabled anonymous (guest) links, you may want to review the impact of this change, with your company security policies. Update your external sharing settings for your SharePoint Online environment, as appropriate.

New SharePoint home experience in Office 365 rolling out starting today MC45964 As announced at the “Future of SharePoint” event on May 4th, we are starting to rollout the new SharePoint home experience in Office 365, starting today, to First Release. The rollout will be completed to all tenants within the course of the next several weeks. We’re committed to evolving your intranet to be more accessible on the go, and more personal with intelligence-driven content based on user activities across sites, the people they work with, and the content they work on. How does this affect me? Starting May 11th, 2016, we will begin to rollout the new SharePoint home experience in Office 365. What was the 'Sites' page is now the 'SharePoint home' and the “Sites” tile becomes the “SharePoint” tile - same logo, redesigned for a modern, responsive user experience.

We’ve made a change to the Office 365 Trust Center MC45937 As you might be aware, Office 365 security, compliance and privacy information is located in the Office 365 Trust Center. As a commitment to transparency, anytime we materially change the data maps, we disclose this information in the Office 365 Trust Center and send you a notification about this change. How does this affect me? The Office 365 data maps were recently revised to include a new datacenter region for Canada, supported by two new datacenter locations we recently brought online in Canada.

How does this affect me? When you create an Office 365 Group, users have two privacy options: public (anyone can access the Group's content) and private (only approved members can access the Group's content). This update enables Group owners to change the privacy setting from public to private or vice versa by editing the Group properties in your favorite browser.

Updated feature: Guests can now sign-up for an account in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business MC45828 We’re updating the external sharing redemption flow for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. You will see this in the next couple weeks. How does this affect me? Previously, guests who wanted to create an account during the redemption flow were required to enter ten or more fields of information, to create an account. This proved to be a huge barrier for guests who are trying to access a resource shared with them. These users will now see the lightweight sign-up flow which only requires a minimal amount of information. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? There is nothing you need to do to prepare for this change. External sharing will continue to work as expected, but guests will find the sign-up process easier to complete.

New feature: Office 365 Groups multi-domain support MC45800 Office 365 Groups multi-domain support is a new Office 365 feature. You’ll begin seeing this new feature starting today. How does this affect me? Larger organizations use separate email domains to reflect different parts of their businesses. Office 365 Groups that are created by users in one domain will share that domain (as opposed to using a common domain across the tenant). Administrators now also have control to create groups in a specific domain of their choosing. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? You don’t need to do anything.

New SharePoint Online features coming soon MC45770 To coincide with the May 4th “Future of SharePoint” event, we’d like to inform of the initial disclosure of several SharePoint items coming to Office 365 and the App Store: the new SharePoint mobile app, a new SharePoint home in Office 365, refreshed team site experiences, responsive page authoring within team sites, a refreshed Site Contents page bringing activities and insights, plus updates to document libraries and lists experiences. In addition, we’ll make available new extensibility opportunities with a simple set of APIs through the Microsoft Graph, Web Hooks to enable custom callbacks, and support for client-side Web Parts enabled through the SharePoint Framework.

On/Starting May 11th, 2016, we will begin to rollout the new SharePoint home, the refreshed Site Contents page, and updated document library and list user experiences.

Feature update: Planned Maintenance notifications moving to Message Center MC45607 We’re changing the way we tell you about Planned Maintenance events. In the old Office 365 Admin center, we notified you about Planned Maintenance in a separate dashboard, under Service Health. Starting June 1, 2016, Planned Maintenance notices will now live in the Message Center, along with the other change notifications about your Office 365 services. How does this affect me? Between now and May 31, we’ll continue to publish Planned Maintenance notifications in the Planned Maintenance dashboard of the old Admin center, as usual. Beginning June 1, planned maintenance announcements will appear as a “Stay Informed” post in Message Center, with no action required on your part. You’ll also be able to see these messages on your mobile device, using the Office 365 Admin app. If a planned maintenance was announced prior to the cutover to Message Center, it will remain on the Service Health Dashboard until the notification expires. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? Keep up to date on changes affecting you, by visiting the Message Center. Download and use the Office 365 Admin app, to stay informed on the go.

This feature is currently only available in the classic Office 365 Admin Center experience, and will not be added to the new Admin Center. How does this affect me? You will no longer be able to subscribe to RSS alerts for service health incidents, when this change is implemented. Instead of using the RSS feeds, we recommend you use the Office 365 Admin app, which now contains push notifications. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? If you do not have the Office 365 Admin app on your mobile device, please go to your mobile app store and download. If you do have the Office 365 Admin app on your mobile device, go into settings and ensure it is configured to receive push notifications for service health incidents.

As previously announced, Yammer will allow users to create a new type of group that includes external users. This is called an external group. This feature will begin rolling out this week. How does this affect me? This feature does not enable existing groups to have external people added. External Groups must created as a new group. If you have already disabled External Messaging in Yammer, your users won't have access to create or participate in External Groups. What do I need to do to prepare for this change?

Updated feature: Changes to Yammer Notification emails MC45346 We are making some improvements to the design and timing of our email notifications which will make it easier for users to parse the notification and decide what's relevant. The new designs are much more visual, and users can still reply by email if they desire. How does this affect me? Over the coming weeks, we will test multiple new designs for Yammer email notifications. These new notifications will still include the core context of the message (snippet of the thread starter, network name, group name, sender avatar and name, additional participants, and a message preview) to enable users to triage and take action appropriately. There are two versions of the message preview length, but in both versions, the entire message will be included for the majority of cases. There are also updates to the business logic which determines when these notifications are sent to help ensure the notifications are relevant to the user. For instance, an email will not be sent if the user views the notification in Yammer and Yammer will not continue to send individual notifications on a specific conversation that the user decides not to engage with. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? You will not need to do anything to prepare for this change.

New feature: Safety Tips in Outlook and Outlook on the web MC45100 Exchange Online Protection (EOP) already protects your organization with industry-leading spam and malware prevention. However, these attacks are so well crafted that they look legitimate. Sometimes putting messages into the Junk Email folder isn’t enough. Over the coming weeks, we’re going to provide additional information when users check their email in Outlook on the web, and in Outlook. How does this affect me? Moving forward, as an example, a red Safety Tip in an email will mean that the message received contains something suspicious. We recommend deleting these types of email messages without opening them. We’ll continue to add more features to Safety Tips to ensure users have the best, most protected experience. What do I need to do to prepare for this change? You don’t need to do anything.

First release tenants have already begun seeing this feature activated and it will be rolling out worldwide over the next few weeks. How does this affect me? Your users will spend less time searching and collecting data and more time using it. Connectors for services like Twitter, Trello, Salesforce and 55 others are available today and developers can also create custom Connectors using incoming webhooks to generate rich connector cards that will show up in Outlook client, OWA and Groups mobile app experiences.

Updated Feature: Yammer is being activated for your Office 365 tenant   Details After significant security and compliance investments, we are proud to announce that Yammer now meets Office 365's industry leading compliance commitments. As a result, all Office 365 tenants with a subscription that includes Yammer, will gain the full benefits of Yammer, without any action required by administrators. The rollout starts now, and you should see this change in the subsequent weeks. \[How does this affect me?\] 1. Once this change is complete, users with a license that includes Yammer can start accessing Yammer from Office 365. For example, they can access Yammer via the Yammer tile in the Office 365 app launcher, or start a Yammer conversation from other Office 365 apps. 2. This change will either create a new Yammer network or connect to an existing Yammer network that has all or a subset of domains managed on the Office 365 tenant. 3. Existing Yammer users who are also Office 365 users would start logging in with their Office 365 credentials, unifying their login experiences. Existing Yammer users who do not have Office 365 credentials will continue to login with their email and password; their experience is not disrupted. 4. Administrators can manage key aspects of the Yammer service from Office 365, including identity, user and license management. \[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?\] There is no action needed from you. If you are not ready to adopt Yammer in your organization, you can un-assign Yammer licenses for those who should not access Yammer from Office 365.

New feature: Managing Yammer licenses in Office 365 Details Managing Yammer licenses is a new Office 365 feature. This is available today for business subscriptions, and will be available to education subscriptions soon. \[How does this affect me?\] As Yammer integrates more closely with Office 365, you will have the option to manage Yammer licenses in Office 365 and control who sees the Yammer tile in the Office 365 app launcher. Previously, Yammer licenses could not be individually assigned to users. You can assign Yammer licenses in the Office 365 admin center or by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets for Office 365. If you purchased Yammer as part of a bundled subscription plan (such as Office 365 Enterprise E3), and had assigned the bundled subscription plan to a user, then after per-user licenses are available, the Yammer license will be automatically assigned to the user. \[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?\] Please click additional information to learn more. https://support.office.com/article/Manage-Yammer-user-licenses-in-Office-365-34a67e3a-3fd8-4e54-bffb-dd5ad0e48590
