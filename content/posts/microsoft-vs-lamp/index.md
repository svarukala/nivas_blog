More than a few might be wondering, whats LAMP and how can  
Microsoft b competing with something called LAMP, as its busy competing  
other big-wigs like Google, Yahoo & ofcourse OSS.  
LAMP stands for \[Linux Apache Mysql (Perl,Python,PHP)].  
A framework of open-source software(OSS).  
Therez another acronym SASH which stands for Struts,Apache,Spring,Hibernate.  
Basically everything currently looks against MS in the web atleast.  
  
Plz read this [link](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+Web+plan+takes+aim+at+Google/2100-1007_3-5855244.html)on how Microsoftz planning to handle this. Sounds good!
