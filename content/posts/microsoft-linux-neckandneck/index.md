I do support Linux, but not just blindly and not just to be anti-microsoft. I know 80% of the guys who boast abt Linux do so just to be anti-microsoft(amusing fact is that they use windows).  
Its proven that windows server 2003 is really v.good and in-par with linux servers.  
  
Heres another news, related to it:  
"[Most U.S. businesses say there is very little difference between the cost of maintaining a Windows versus a Linux-based corporate computing environment, according to a new Yankee Group](http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?storyID=8081636&type=technologyNews)"
