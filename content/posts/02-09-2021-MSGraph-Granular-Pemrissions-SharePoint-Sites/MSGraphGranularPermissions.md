# Summary
Microsoft Graph now allows you to apply granular permissions to SharePoint Online Sites for Azure AD Applications. I posted this blog on [dev.to platform](https://dev.to/svarukala/use-microsoft-graph-to-set-granular-permissions-to-sharepoint-online-sites-for-azure-ad-application-4l12) for better findability. This blog post is a summary and link to that article. This way I want to keep track of my contributions at once place i.e. in this blog site.


Hope that helps!
