I did AJAX long before it was even termed as AJAX! Yes its true.  
AJAX to put in a line is 'not to refresh the page for each request'..  
and thats wat I did in my research work in my masters using java-script,  
xml RPC method calling.  
So its AJAX ruling the web,...yet its simple java script/dhtml...  
  
Check this [link](http://www.start.com/3/), an MSN portal which mimicks google personalized portal.
